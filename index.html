    <p>While recognizing any individual, the most important attribute is face. It serves as an individual identity of everyone and therefore face recognition helps in authenticating any person's identity using his personal characteristics. The whole procedure for authenticating any face data is sub-divided into two phases, in the first phase, the face detection is done quickly except for those cases in which the object is placed quite far, followed by this the second phase is initiated in which the face is recognized as an individual. Then the whole process is repeated thereby helping in developing a face recognition model which is considered to be one of the most extremely deliberated biometric technology. Basically, there are two type of techniques that are currently being followed in face recognition pattern that is, the Eigenface method and the Fisherface method. The Eigenface method basically make use of the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to minimize the face dimensional space of the facial features. The area of concern of this paper is using the digital image processing to develop a face recognition system.

     <h1>Introduction</h1>
     <br><br>
     <p>Recent advances in automated face analysis, pattern recognition and machine learning have made it possible to develop automatic face recognition systems to address these applications. On the one hand, recognising face is natural process, because people usually do it effortlessly without much conscious. On the other hand, application of this process in area of computer vision remains a difficult problem. Being part of a biometric technology, automated face recognition has a plenty of desirable properties. They are based on the important advantage—non‐invasiveness. The various biometric methods can be distinguished into physiological (fingerprint, DNA, face) and behavioural (keystroke, voice print) categories. The physiological approaches are more stable and non‐alterable, except by severe injury. Behavioural patterns are more sensitive to human overall condition, such as stress, illness or fatigue.</p>
    <br>
    <br><br>
     <p>Face detection performance is a key issue, so techniques for dealing with non‐frontal face detection are discussed. Subspace modelling and learning‐based dimension reduction methods are fundamental to many current face recognition techniques. Discovering such algorithms so as to extract effective features and construct robust classifiers stands another challenge in this area. Face recognition has merits of both high accuracy and low intrusive, so it has drawn the attention of the researches in various fields from psychology, image processing to computer vision.</p>
